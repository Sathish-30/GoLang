### GoLang

> Installation done from - https://go.dev/ , GoLang is an open-source programming language supported by Google

- Go Lang mainly requires packages , which can be declared as main.

- It also requires a main method where it can start the program execution.

- Where it's functions are mainly retrieved from the packages , there are many packages (fmt) is the package for getting the print method.

- If we declare a varibale but not used the variable it will throw a error

- `const conferenceTickets = 30` , In const keyword we can't change the value

- Print format(Printf) function is used to print using format specifier

- %v is used to display the value in a default format

- %#v a Go-syntax representation of the value

- %T a Go-syntax representation of the type of the value

- uint can't be assigned with a negative number

- Like assigning `var name = "Sathish" ` we can assign as `name := "Sathish"`

- Pointers are said to be as special variables

- `var bookings = [10]string{"Sathish","sandi","karthi","chittappa","ratish"}` The following code is the static initialization of array

- Other way of array initialization `var bookingNames [10]string`

- Slice is an abstraction of an array , it is also index based .Slices are more flexible and powerful :variable length or to get the sub array of it own
